# Problem Statement

# Fill out print_multiple(message, repeats), which takes as parameters a string message to print, and an integer repeats number of times to print message. We've written the main() function for you, which prompts the user for a message and a number of repeats.

# Solution

# This program prints a message multiple times based on user input

def print_multiple(message, repeats):
    for _ in range(repeats):
        print(message)

def main():
    message = input("Please type a message: ")
    repeats = int(input("Enter a number of times to repeat your message: "))
    print_multiple(message, repeats)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
